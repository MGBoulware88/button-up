This project is to practice CSS styling.

I need to make 3 different buttons:

1. An oval with turqoise border and centered text "Search" that is filled in white
2. A green circle with a centered, white + sign
3. A rectangle with blue fill, white, centered "Create Account" text, a black border, and a black shadow
